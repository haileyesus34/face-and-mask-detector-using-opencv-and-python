# Basic example of face and mask detection using OpenCV and Python
Since OpenCV alone doesn't come with pre-trained models for mask detection, we can use a simple color-based approach to detect masks. 
This approach is based on detecting the lower part of the face and checking for dominant colors (assuming the mask is of a certain color, like blue or white).

However, for more accurate results, a deep learning model like MobileNetV2 trained specifically for mask detection would be more appropriate. but this would involve additional libraries like TensorFlow or Keras. Below is a simple version using only OpenCV.
